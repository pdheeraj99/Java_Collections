# Comparable vs. Comparator ⚔️ - The Ultimate Sorting Guide

Mawa, collections like [`TreeSet`](../../03-Set-Interface/4-TreeSet/README.md), [`TreeMap`](../../05-Map-Interface/4-TreeMap/README.md), and [`PriorityQueue`](../../04-Queue-Interface/3-PriorityQueue/README.md), or sorting methods like `Collections.sort()` ki, manam create chesina custom objects ni (e.g., `Employee`, `Player`) ela sort cheyalo teliyadu. "Ee object peddada? Aa object peddada?" ani daaniki ardham kaadu.

Manam aa sorting logic ni Java ki cheppadaniki use cheseవే ee two powerful interfaces: `Comparable` and `Comparator`.

## 1. `Comparable` Interface (Natural Order)

`Comparable` defines the **natural ordering** for an object. It's the default, most obvious way to sort objects of a certain type.

**The "Height" Analogy 📏:**
Imagine a group of people. Prathi person ki oka "natural" height untadi. It's an **intrinsic property** of the person. If someone asks you to line them up by height, there's a default, natural way to do it. `Comparable` is like that natural height.

**How it works:**
*   Your class **itself** implements the `Comparable` interface.
*   You have to override one method: `public int compareTo(T other)`.
*   **Location:** `java.lang` package (so fundamental, no import needed).

**The `compareTo` Contract:**
The `compareTo` method should return:
*   **Negative number:** if `this` object is "less than" the `other` object.
*   **Zero:** if `this` object is "equal to" the `other` object.
*   **Positive number:** if `this` object is "greater than" the `other` object.

*(See the `Player` class in the code example which implements `Comparable` to sort by rank naturally).*

## 2. `Comparator` Interface (Custom Order)

`Comparator` defines a **custom or external ordering**. It's used when the natural order is not what you want, or when you need multiple different ways to sort the same objects.

**The "Queue Manager" Analogy 👨‍💼:**
Imagine the same group of people at a party. A manager (`Comparator`) can ask them to line up in many different ways:
*   "Line up alphabetically by name!" (Name Comparator)
*   "Line up by your ticket number!" (Ticket Number Comparator)
*   "Line up by your seating row!" (Seat Comparator)

The sorting logic is **not** an intrinsic property of the person. It's an **external rule** applied by the manager. `Comparator` is that external manager.

**How it works:**
*   You create a **separate class** that implements the `Comparator` interface.
*   You have to override one method: `public int compare(T o1, T o2)`.
*   **Location:** `java.util` package.

*(See `PlayerNameComparator` in the code example for a custom sorting rule).*

## The Ultimate Showdown: `Comparable` vs. `Comparator`

| Feature | `Comparable` | `Comparator` |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Purpose** | Defines a single, **natural** ordering for a class. | Defines **multiple, custom** orderings for a class. |
| **Analogy** | Intrinsic Property (Height) | External Rule (Queue Manager) |
| **Package** | `java.lang` | `java.util` |
| **Method** | `int compareTo(T other)` | `int compare(T o1, T o2)` |
| **Implementation**| The class **itself** must implement this interface. | A **separate** class implements this interface. |
| **Modification**| Modifies the original class's source code. | **Doesn't touch** the original class. |
| **Primary Use Case**| Providing a default sort order for your objects. | Sorting objects in ways other than their natural order, or sorting objects from a library you can't modify. |
| **Lambda Friendliness** | No | **Excellent**. Perfect for creating concise, on-the-fly sorting rules. |

### When to Use Which?

*   **Use `Comparable` when:** Your object has a clear, single, "natural" way to be sorted. For an `Employee` class, sorting by `employeeId` is a good natural order. For a `Movie` class, sorting by `releaseDate` could be a natural order.

*   **Use `Comparator` when:**
    1.  The class you want to sort is **not yours** (e.g., from a 3rd party library), so you can't make it implement `Comparable`.
    2.  You need **multiple different ways to sort** your objects (e.g., sort employees by name, then by salary, then by department).
    3.  You want to write a quick, one-off sorting rule using a **lambda expression**.
        ```java
        // Sort players by name in reverse, using a lambda
        players.sort((p1, p2) -> p2.getName().compareTo(p1.getName()));
        ```

> 💡 **Punchline:** `Comparable` is like being born with a talent (your natural order). `Comparator` is like hiring a coach who can train you in many different skills (multiple, external sort orders).

Understanding both gives you complete control over sorting in Java!
